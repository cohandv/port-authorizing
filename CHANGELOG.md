## [Unreleased]

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated binary releases
- Multi-platform binary builds (Linux, macOS, Windows for amd64/arm64)
- Protocol maturity matrix in documentation
- Docker image can now be used as CLI client
- Enhanced version command with build information
- Comprehensive release process with checksums

### Changed
- Unified CLI and API into single `port-authorizing` binary
- Updated documentation to reflect support for any service type (not just databases)
- Improved Docker Hub README with client usage examples
- Enhanced Dockerfile with client mode instructions

### Fixed
- Fixed CLI flag parsing after unification (apiURL and configPath)
- Fixed connection proxy issues with proper variable scoping
- PostgreSQL username validation to prevent impersonation
- Query whitelist enforcement (was being bypassed)
- Case-insensitive regex matching for whitelists
- Client hanging on blocked queries (now sends proper PostgreSQL errors)

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed PostgreSQL authentication bypass where any username/password was accepted after JWT authentication
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed whitelist bypass allowing developers to execute DELETE queries despite SELECT-only whitelist
- Added username validation to ensure psql client username matches authenticated API user
- Added ReadyForQuery message after error responses to prevent client hangs

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release (if applicable)

### Added
- Multi-provider authentication (Local, OIDC, LDAP, SAML2)
- Role-based access control with tag-based policies
- PostgreSQL transparent proxy with query whitelisting
- HTTP/HTTPS transparent proxy
- TCP basic proxy
- Time-limited connections with automatic expiry
- Comprehensive audit logging
- JWT token-based authentication
- Docker support with multi-architecture images
- CLI for connection management
- API server for proxy coordination

### Protocol Support
- âœ… PostgreSQL: Mature (full protocol awareness)
- âœ… HTTP/HTTPS: Mature (transparent proxying)
- ðŸš§ TCP: Beta (basic proxying)
