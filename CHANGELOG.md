## [Unreleased]

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated binary releases
- Multi-platform binary builds (Linux, macOS, Windows for amd64/arm64)
- Protocol maturity matrix in documentation
- Docker image can now be used as CLI client
- Enhanced version command with build information

- Added username validation to ensure psql client username matches authenticated API user
- Added ReadyForQuery message after error responses to prevent client hangs

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release (if applicable)

### Added
