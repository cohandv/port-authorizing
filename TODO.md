## In Progress üöß

- [ ] LLM risk analysis integration (stub created, needs full implementation)

## Future Enhancements üìã

### High Priority

- [ ] **Full PostgreSQL Wire Protocol**
  - [ ] Complete protocol parser
  - [ ] Transaction support
  - [ ] Prepared statements
  - [ ] Binary protocol support

- [ ] **User Management**
  - [ ] Password hashing (bcrypt)
  - [ ] Database-backed users
  - [ ] User roles and permissions
  - [ ] User registration API

- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - [ ] TLS/HTTPS support for API
  - [ ] mTLS for client authentication
  - [ ] Token refresh mechanism
  - [ ] Token revocation

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  - [ ] Per-user limits
  - [ ] Per-connection limits
  - [ ] Configurable time windows

- [ ] **Monitoring & Metrics**
  - [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint
  - [ ] Active connection tracking
  - [ ] Request rate metrics
  - [ ] Error rate tracking

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Unit tests for all packages
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end tests
  - [ ] Load testing

- [ ] **Enhanced Protocols**
  - [ ] MySQL protocol support
  - [ ] MongoDB protocol support
  - [ ] WebSocket support
  - [ ] gRPC support

### Low Priority

- [ ] **CLI Enhancements**
  - [ ] Auto-completion support
  - [ ] Connection profiles
  - [ ] History of connections
  - [ ] Status command

- [ ] **API Enhancements**
  - [ ] WebSocket for real-time updates
  - [ ] GraphQL API
  - [ ] API versioning
  - [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI docs

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Docker images
  - [ ] Kubernetes manifests
  - [ ] Helm charts
  - [ ] systemd service files

- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - [ ] Connection pooling
  - [ ] Query caching
  - [ ] Load balancing across multiple backends
  - [ ] Failover support

## Known Issues üêõ

- PostgreSQL proxy is simplified and doesn't fully implement wire protocol
- LLM integration is a stub and needs real implementation
- No password hashing (uses plain text in config)
- No persistent storage (all in-memory)
- CLI local proxy is basic and may not handle all edge cases

## Documentation Needed üìö

- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Contributing guidelines
- [ ] Security best practices guide
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Performance tuning guide

## Research & Investigation üîç

- [ ] Investigate PostgreSQL COPY protocol for bulk operations
- [ ] Research best practices for proxy connection pooling
- [ ] Evaluate different LLM providers for security analysis
- [ ] Study rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, leaky bucket)
- [ ] Investigate zero-trust network architecture patterns
